Logistic Regression Model for Scapula (KNN_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -73.625781

Coefficients:
  Scapula height: 0.319801
  Scapula breadth: 0.234261

Feature Order:
Scapula height, Scapula breadth

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -73.626 + 0.320 × Scapula height + 0.234 × Scapula breadth

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -73.626 + (0.320 × [your Scapula height]) + (0.234 × [your Scapula breadth])
