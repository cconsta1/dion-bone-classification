Logistic Regression Model for Clavicle (KNN_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -48.842807

Coefficients:
  Clavicle maximum length: 0.223322
  Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft: 0.598602
  Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft: 1.010446

Feature Order:
Clavicle maximum length, Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft, Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -48.843 + 0.223 × Clavicle maximum length + 0.599 × Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft + 1.010 × Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -48.843 + (0.223 × [your Clavicle maximum length]) + (0.599 × [your Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (1.010 × [your Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft])
