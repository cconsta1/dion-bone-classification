Logistic Regression Model for Clavicle (Iterative_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -35.886298

Coefficients:
  Clavicle maximum length: 0.052276
  Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft: 1.070396
  Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft: 1.504938

Feature Order:
Clavicle maximum length, Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft, Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -35.886 + 0.052 × Clavicle maximum length + 1.070 × Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft + 1.505 × Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -35.886 + (0.052 × [your Clavicle maximum length]) + (1.070 × [your Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (1.505 × [your Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft])
