Logistic Regression Model for Scapula (KNN_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -54.066931

Coefficients:
  Scapula height: 0.047695
  Scapula breadth: 0.460451

Feature Order:
Scapula height, Scapula breadth

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -54.067 + 0.048 × Scapula height + 0.460 × Scapula breadth

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -54.067 + (0.048 × [your Scapula height]) + (0.460 × [your Scapula breadth])
