Logistic Regression Model for Fibula (Iterative_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -39.921464

Coefficients:
  Fibula maximum length: 0.085089
  Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft: 0.687816

Feature Order:
Fibula maximum length, Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -39.921 + 0.085 × Fibula maximum length + 0.688 × Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -39.921 + (0.085 × [your Fibula maximum length]) + (0.688 × [your Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft])
