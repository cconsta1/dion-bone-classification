Logistic Regression Model for Radius (KNN_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -62.038987

Coefficients:
  Radius maximum length: 0.134619
  Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft: 1.129313
  Radius transverse diameter at midshaft: 1.276384

Feature Order:
Radius maximum length, Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft, Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -62.039 + 0.135 × Radius maximum length + 1.129 × Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft + 1.276 × Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -62.039 + (0.135 × [your Radius maximum length]) + (1.129 × [your Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (1.276 × [your Radius transverse diameter at midshaft])
