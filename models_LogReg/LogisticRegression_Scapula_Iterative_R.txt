Logistic Regression Model for Scapula (Iterative_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -57.971320

Coefficients:
  Scapula height: 0.284018
  Scapula breadth: 0.149158

Feature Order:
Scapula height, Scapula breadth

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -57.971 + 0.284 × Scapula height + 0.149 × Scapula breadth

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -57.971 + (0.284 × [your Scapula height]) + (0.149 × [your Scapula breadth])
