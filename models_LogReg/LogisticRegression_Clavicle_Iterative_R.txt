Logistic Regression Model for Clavicle (Iterative_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -25.139630

Coefficients:
  Clavicle maximum length: 0.047656
  Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft: -0.068545
  Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft: 2.059268

Feature Order:
Clavicle maximum length, Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft, Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -25.140 + 0.048 × Clavicle maximum length + -0.069 × Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft + 2.059 × Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -25.140 + (0.048 × [your Clavicle maximum length]) + (-0.069 × [your Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (2.059 × [your Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft])
