Logistic Regression Model for Radius (Iterative_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -25.829256

Coefficients:
  Radius maximum length: -0.003421
  Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft: 1.035305
  Radius transverse diameter at midshaft: 0.963312

Feature Order:
Radius maximum length, Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft, Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -25.829 + -0.003 × Radius maximum length + 1.035 × Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft + 0.963 × Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -25.829 + (-0.003 × [your Radius maximum length]) + (1.035 × [your Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (0.963 × [your Radius transverse diameter at midshaft])
