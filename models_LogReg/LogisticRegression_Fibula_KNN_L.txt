Logistic Regression Model for Fibula (KNN_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -47.556966

Coefficients:
  Fibula maximum length: 0.124300
  Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft: 0.300469

Feature Order:
Fibula maximum length, Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -47.557 + 0.124 × Fibula maximum length + 0.300 × Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -47.557 + (0.124 × [your Fibula maximum length]) + (0.300 × [your Fibula maximum diameter at midshaft])
