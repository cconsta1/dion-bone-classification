Logistic Regression Model for Radius (Iterative_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -63.954709

Coefficients:
  Radius maximum length: 0.153729
  Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft: 0.667878
  Radius transverse diameter at midshaft: 1.480128

Feature Order:
Radius maximum length, Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft, Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -63.955 + 0.154 × Radius maximum length + 0.668 × Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft + 1.480 × Radius transverse diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -63.955 + (0.154 × [your Radius maximum length]) + (0.668 × [your Radius sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (1.480 × [your Radius transverse diameter at midshaft])
