Logistic Regression Model for Calcaneus (Iterative_L)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -46.197127

Coefficients:
  Calcaneus maximum length: 0.405274
  Calcaneus middle breadth: 0.347382

Feature Order:
Calcaneus maximum length, Calcaneus middle breadth

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -46.197 + 0.405 × Calcaneus maximum length + 0.347 × Calcaneus middle breadth

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -46.197 + (0.405 × [your Calcaneus maximum length]) + (0.347 × [your Calcaneus middle breadth])
