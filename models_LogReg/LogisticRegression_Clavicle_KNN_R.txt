Logistic Regression Model for Clavicle (KNN_R)

Binary classification: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Samples used: 48

Intercept: -29.996450

Coefficients:
  Clavicle maximum length: 0.066231
  Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft: 0.511115
  Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft: 1.495637

Feature Order:
Clavicle maximum length, Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft, Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Classification Rule:
Compute the score using your measurements:

  Score = -29.996 + 0.066 × Clavicle maximum length + 0.511 × Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft + 1.496 × Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft

Then apply the rule:
  If Score > 0 → Classify as Male
  If Score ≤ 0 → Classify as Female

Example (replace values with your measurements):
  Score = -29.996 + (0.066 × [your Clavicle maximum length]) + (0.511 × [your Clavicle sagittal diameter at midshaft]) + (1.496 × [your Clavicle vertical diameter at midshaft])
